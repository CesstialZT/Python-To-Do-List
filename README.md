# Python-To-Do-List
A simplistic todo list made in Python that is free to copy and make your own. It uses Tkinter to make a window with buttons and a To-Do List.

Enter a task into the input bar and press "Add Task" to add it as a new task. Select a task and press "Remove Task" to delete it from the list.
This was designed to be basic, and took no longer than half an hour to program.

PS, tasks don't save. I might add task saving in the future, so you can add a task and see it next time you open the app.
